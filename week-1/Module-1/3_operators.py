# print( 3 ** 5)

# Comparison Operators

x = 10

# print(x > y)  # Greater than
# print(x < y)  # Less than
# print(x == y) # Equal to

# Logical Operators

a = True

# print(a and b) # if one is false then result is false
# print(a or b) # if one is true then result if true
# print(not a) # make positive ti negative
